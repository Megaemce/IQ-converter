I looked around for explanation on differences between range of IQ scales and hence I was still not able to understand it fully I decided to build my own tool to convert scores from different scales.

Take a note that RAPM/RSPM/Otis-Lennon means and standard deviations were taken from [this paper](http://arthurjensen.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Equating-the-Standard-and-Advanced-Forms-of-the-Raven-Progressive-Matrices-1988-by-Arthur-Robert-Jensen-Dennis-P.-Saccuzzo-Gerald-E.-Larson.pdf). For RAPM I adjusted them so they match my result, maximum possible result (185) and the information that I already found online (for example in [this question](https://www.reddit.com/r/mensa/comments/iwwf5j/ravens_advanced_progressive_matrices_raw_score/)).

Any feedback is more than welcome!
